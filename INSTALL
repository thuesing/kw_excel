$ cd my_project_folder
$ virtualenv venv

virtualenv venv will create a folder in the current directory which will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the pip library which you can use to install other packages. The name of the virtual environment (in this case, it was venv) can be anything



To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

$ source venv/bin/activate


Install packages as usual, for example:

$ pip install requests

# Version

>>> import py2neo
>>> py2neo.__version__
